# SketchOverlay
A free alternative to subscription based screen drawing tools.  
Left click to draw, middle click to toggle/drag tool window.  
Toggle the canvas using the eye icon (found at the top of the screen)

Originally, SketchOverlay was intended to be a Windows targeted MAUI application.  
However, the focus has shifted to WPF due to MAUI's lack of transparent borderless window support.  
Hopefully we'll receive the missing feature in the near future, in which case, MAUI will once again become the primary focus.

MAUI feature request: https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/1247
