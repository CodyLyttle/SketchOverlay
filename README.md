# SketchOverlay
A free alternative to subscription model screen drawing tools.

Originally, SketchOverlay was intended to be a Windows targeted MAUI application.  
However, the focus has shifted to WPF due to MAUI's lack of transparent borderless window support.  
Hopefully we'll receive the missing feature in the near future, in which case, MAUI will once again become the primary focus.
